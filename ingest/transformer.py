Transformation and promotion contracts from staging to curated in DuckDB.

Traceability:
- docs/specs/gherkin/bdd-duckdb_ingest_api_ui.md
  Sections:
    - 1) Ingestion & Staging: dedup via QUALIFY ROW_NUMBER
    - 2) Transform & Promote: CTAS, CHECK constraints, PK/unique constraints,
      jersey TEXT preservation, DECIMAL(9,3), alias normalization, MERGE upsert
    - 3) API Expectations: downstream consumers rely on curated schemas

This module exposes only function signatures and docstrings to guide tests.
No SQL or transformation logic is implemented at this phase.

def promote_staging_to_curated(*, options: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None) -> None:
    """Promote validated and deduplicated staging data to curated tables.

    Intended Implementation Notes (for Red/Green phases)
    ---------------------------------------------------
    - Create curated tables via CTAS or CREATE TABLE as SELECT with explicit types.
    - Apply CHECK constraints (e.g., 0 ≤ rate ≤ 1).
    - Ensure primary keys and unique constraints per curated grains (ERD v0.3).
    - Preserve jersey TEXT semantics and DECIMAL(9,3) precision.
    - Normalize historical team aliases consistently.
    - Use MERGE for upserts to support partial refreshes.

    Acceptance References
    ---------------------
    - Transform Scenario: curated tables exist; constraints evaluate true; unique constraints clean.
    - League Averages Scenario: union view strategy (separate concern).
    - Partial refresh Scenario: MERGE-based upsert behavior.

    Parameters
    ----------
    options : Optional[Dict[str, Any]]
        Placeholder for configuration flags (e.g., recreate, incremental).

    Returns
    -------
    None

    This is a stub and intentionally does nothing to enable failing tests in Red phase.
